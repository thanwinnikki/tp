### Project: ThunderCat

ThunderCat is a desktop application designed for NUS Year 2 Computer Science students. The application acts as an 
address book for contacts with added support for groups and group tasks management. The application is optimised for 
students who can type fast as it uses a Command Line Interface (CLI), while still having the benefits of a Graphical 
User Interface (GUI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to list all groups in ThunderCat.
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to list all group members and tasks in a group.
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add a new task to a group.
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to mark a task in a group as done.
  * What it does: 
    * Allows the User to mark a task in a group as done. 
    * Supports the undo function, allowing the User to easily reverse their action.
  * Justification: This feature makes the 'task' in ThunderCat much more realistic and increases functionality, 
    allowing the User to keep track of which tasks are done and which tasks are not.
  
* **Enhancements implemented**:
  * Added Task-related exception classes 
  * Added UniqueTaskList class that enforces uniqueness between its elements to support Task-related commands in ThunderCat.
  * Added Task-related classes in test such as TypicalTasks, TaskBuilder and TaskUtil classes to support testing for Task-related features.
  * Added Group-related exception classes
  * Added Group-related class TypicalGroups to support testing for Group-related features.
